**A/B Test Name:**  Light or Dark Mode
**User Story Number:**  User Story 5  
**Metric (HeartGrid):**     
The toggling of light or dark mode on from our app can be tracked as a metric through firebase and google analytics, by creating a custom event trigger. For example we can run a simple javascript line that will log events whenever a particular button (or switch) is pressed. Effectively, when the user decides to open settings and toggle a dark mode switch (or lightmode) the event will trigger and log the event. From here we can create custom reports or dashboards in firebase's google analytics to then track the usage of dark and light mode, as well as check if people swapped back immediately, or how long until their next flip of the switch.
