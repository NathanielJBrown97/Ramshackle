#Lean Canvas Business Plan for Ramshackle - Home Repair Management App  
Our lean canvas approach was to identify the major problems users of Ramshackle have. Ramshackle is a simple way to keep track of your home maintenance records and maintain a contact list of repair service providers that have performed past projects in your home. The primary demographics being homeowners, retners, property managers, or repair maintenance companies. The main problems these users might encounter in their traditional Ramshackle-free lifestyles are: losing contractor information or invoices, forgetting repairs they've recently completed, or losing track of what has been fixed and where when managing multiple properties, or even simply forgetting a repair has been scheduled (or needs to be scheduled)! Our solution to this is through the implementation of a system to log all of the users home repair information, showcasing who made a repair and when, what was exactly repaired, and what needs to be addressed in the immediate future! With capabalities to log multiple homes and store their information seperately we increase our potential to property managers themselves! Our cost structure is virtually free as we're all working on this projet for free; but our revenue streams allow for banner ads (initially) and ideally a direct charge to home repair companies. They pay the fee, users use ramshackle for free. In return Ramshackle will encourage or remind them to book with the associated home repair companies.

#Persona Grids  
1.) New Home Owner - As a new home owner, I want to be able to log work that has been done on my house, as well as planned maintenance so that I have everything all in one convenient place. As a new home owner, I can fill out information attached to my profile representing work that has been done, and work that needs to get done. 
- These new home owners need to be able to identify and log past repairs on their new property and properly address repairs that need to be scheduled and conducted soon. Ramshackle provides this to our users by having a profile section in which they can upload all of their past repairs on their home so that they can be recorded in the system. It will also have a section in which the user can input plans for future updates.  
  
2.) Current Renter - As a renter I want to be able to inform my landlord of maintenance issues and repairs needed by my apartment. As a renter, I can view past submitted work requests and see the progress of ones that are currently submitted.
- These renters are not responsible for maintenance and repairs of their home, renters are dependent on their landlord for all these issues to be addressed. This provides the user a way to properly log and report to their landlord all issues that need to be addressed. Ramshackle provides this centralized way for users to submit repair requests which will be received by landlords to schedule maintenance and repairs, categorized by urgency. The workflow will provide a means to assign jobs to workers and track progress.  
  
3.) Property Manager - As a property manager, I want to be able to log maintenace requests from different tenants/properties so that they can be kept in one place. As a property manager, I can sort logged maintenance requests by date of request, deadline, apartment, and cost. 
- These property managers find it very difficult to track the state of maintenace requests and upkeep on large numbers of properties. They need a way to properly organize a lot of information and sort by importance, deadline, and cost. Ramshackle provides a feature that allows the property managers to log maintenance requests, and set routine upkeep reminders. Ramshackle also provides a sorting feature by date, apartment, status, for users that log multiple homes.  
  
4.) Repair Maintenace Companies - As a repair/maintenance company owner, I want to be able to record work that has been completed/needs to be completed, so that I can easily make a reference to or plan accordingly for the next appointment. As a repair/maintenance company owner, I can have the option to add/delete/view past work that has been done or needs to be done for a client.
- These repair/maintenance companies maintain clientele whom own a multitude of homes and apartments. There is a ton of information that they need to log and sort, as well as reaching out to these vast multitudes of demographics. Ramshackle addresses this by allowing the repair/maintenance companies to store and retrieve past work from their customers within our databases. Ramshackle could also provide these companies with notifications that past homeowners (or new homeowners) are in need of work related to their field.  
  
5.) Home Owners (two years or More) - As a home owner (of two years or more), I want to be able to track a multitude of fixes and modifications that have happened on my house, and keep track of all of their respective contractor information. As a home owner (of two years or more), I can keep track of thsi information by storing the information on ramshackle and be reminded of what needs fixing, and when to schedule a new appointment or repair based off of ramshakcles notification system.
- These home owners (of two years or more) are in desperate need of a notification system that functions off of their logged personal profile information. Ramshackle provides this by sending notifications based upon relevant data entries in their profile accounts, providing up to date and relevant information for users.
