# Feedback Item 1 <Response 4>
**Observation Statement:**  
Date fields are not wide enough, light mode/dark mode is inconsistent. As well as a suggestion to export projects into an excel sheet, for those that like to manage locally and organize personal data. 

**Supporting Data / Reason:**  
Perhaps the user’s phone is more narrow and we have not tested narrower phones. This could explain the date fields not being wide enough. Light/Dark mode is inconsistent due to a bug spotted by the user! As it stands currently the Light/Dark mode theme is a global variable across ALL USERS. As for the suggestion; I’m assuming that this internal tester is more organized and wants a way to manipulate the data they may store initially in the app externally through spreadsheet managing services. (Great feedback).

**UserStory Label:**  
As a general user, I WANT Ramshackle TO be able to export the events and plans stored as an .xlsx format so that I can use the file on either Microsoft Excel or google sheets.

**Observation Statement:**  
Overall users were able to navigate through the app easily. Some people did have trouble navigating through.

 **Supporting Data/Reason:**  
Most users, roughly 50%, were satisfied with navigation. One person commented that ‘instead of the ramshackle logo there may be a more intuitive way of locating the menu bar’ the ramshackle / menu bar should be accessible throughout the application not just from the main menu.

**User Story Label:**  
As a general user, I WANT the navigation menu TO be accessible from all screens within the app and be clearly labeled
