# Observation 1: Issue with navigation
**Observation Statement:**  
Overall users were able to  navigate through the fairly easy. Some people did have trouble some navigating though
**Supporting Data:**  
The majority of users, 60% were satisfied with navigation. One person did comment saying that “instead of the Ramshackle logo there may be a more intuitive way of locating the menu bar; the Ramshackle / menu bar should be accessible throughout the application not just from the main menu”
**Team Action:**  
Based on this feedback we could alter the app so that the navigation works on each page and maybe add a button somewhere on the top of the application which says menu, or a common symbol used as menu such as a stack of 3 lines. Since most of the respondents did have issues though this would not be a priority issue to resolve.


# Observation 2: Various improvements can be made 
**Observation Statement:**  
Overall, respondants had mostly positive feedback regarding the application. A handful of them did comment though on ways the application could be improved
 **Supporting Data:**  
A respondent responded with a comment of “Date fields are not wide enough, light mode/dark mode is inconsistent. As well as a suggestion to export projects into an excel sheet, for those that like to manage locally and organize personal data.”
**Team Action:**  
We can create various user stories to address each improvement and make address them each with a given priority.
